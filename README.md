This personal project was created as a way to strengthen my software development skills through hands-on experience. The application allows users to track expenses by entering custom amounts and selecting from a variety of predefined categories. Each expense is added to a running list, which can be saved for future use.

Users also have the ability to load previously saved budgets, making it easy to continue managing their finances across sessions. While the core functionality is in place, I plan to continue refining the appâ€”especially by improving the user experience and adding more intuitive features.
